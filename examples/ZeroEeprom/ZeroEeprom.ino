/**
 * @file ZeroEEPROM.ino
 * @brief Example sketch that writes zeros to each byte of the MiP user EEPROM.
 *
 * @details
 * This sketch demonstrates how to iterate over the MiP's user EEPROM address
 * range and write a zero value to each byte using the eeprom.write() API.
 * After writing each byte the sketch reads it back with eeprom.read() and
 * prints the address and recovered value to mip.console for verification.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - eeprom.write()
 *   - eeprom.read()
 *
 * Usage notes:
 *   - Running this sketch will overwrite the MiP user EEPROM contents with
 *     zeros. Use with caution if the EEPROM contains important data.
 *   - The sketch pauses one second between writes so the user can observe
 *     progress on mip.console and the device.

 * - Iterates over the MiP user EEPROM address range from 0x00 up to
 *   (MiP_EEPROM::LAST_EEPROM_ADDRESS - MiP_EEPROM::BASE_EEPROM_ADDRESS)
 * inclusive and:
 *     1. Writes a zero to each EEPROM offset using eeprom.write(offset, 0x00).
 *     2. Waits one second to allow observation and avoid flooding the device.
 *     3. Reads the byte back with eeprom.read(offset) and prints the address
 *        and recovered value in hexadecimal to mip.console for verification.
 *
 * Note:
 *   - This operation will irreversibly overwrite any existing user EEPROM
 *     data stored on the MiP. Back up any important data before running.
