/**
 * @file SoftwareHardwareVersion.ino
 * @brief Example sketch that reads MiP's software and hardware version
 * information. It also displays the MPU:D1 mini library version.
 *
 * @details
 * This sketch demonstrates how to query a MiP for its software version and
 * hardware information using the MiP library. It:
 *   - Initializes communication with the MiP using mip.begin().
 *   - Reads the software version into a MiPSoftwareVersion struct via
 *     version.readSoftware() and prints a formatted date and unique version.
 *   - Reads hardware information into a MiPHardwareInfo struct via
 *     version.readHardware() and prints voice chip and hardware revision
 * details.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - version.readSoftware()
 *   - version.readHardware()
 *
 * The output is printed to Serial1 in a human-readable format so the user can
 * inspect the device's firmware date and build as well as hardware revision
 * information.
