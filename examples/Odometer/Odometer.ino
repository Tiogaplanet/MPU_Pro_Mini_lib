/**
 * @file Odometer.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating MiP's odometer read and reset operations.
 *
 * @details This sketch shows how to use the MiP library to read the total
 * distance MiP has traveled since the last reset and how to reset the
 * odometer value. It prints the current distance in centimeters to mip.console,
 * calls odometer.reset() to clear the measurement, and reads back the distance
 * again to verify the reset succeeded.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - mip.begin()
 *   - mip.odometer.read()
 *   - mip.odometer.reset()

 *   - Reads the current odometer value (in centimeters) using
 *     odometer.read() and prints it to mip.console.
 *   - Resets the odometer using odometer.reset().
 *   - Re-reads odometer.read() to verify the distance counter was cleared.
