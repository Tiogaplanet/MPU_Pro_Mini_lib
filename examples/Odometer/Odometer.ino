/**
 * @file Odometer.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating MiP odometer read and reset.
 *
 * @details This sketch shows how to use the MiP library to read the total
 * distance the robot has traveled since the last reset and how to reset that
 * odometer value. It prints the current distance in centimeters to Serial1,
 * then calls odometer.reset() to clear the measurement.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - odometer.read()
 *   - odometer.reset()

 *     odometer.read() and prints it to Serial1.
 *   - Resets the odometer using odometer.reset().

 * The function prints progress and completion messages to Serial1 so the
