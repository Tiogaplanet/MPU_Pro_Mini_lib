/**
 * @file Stop.ino
 * @brief Demonstrates interrupting motion with the MiP stop() API.
 *
 * @details
 * This simple example shows how to start a long turn and then interrupt it
 * using the motion.stop() function. The sketch:
 *   - Connects to the MiP using begin().
 *   - Commands a 360-degree left turn with motion.turnLeft(360, 6).
 *   - Waits briefly and then calls motion.stop() to interrupt the motion.
 *   - Prints progress messages to Serial1 for observation.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - begin()
 *   - motion.turnLeft()
 *   - motion.stop()
