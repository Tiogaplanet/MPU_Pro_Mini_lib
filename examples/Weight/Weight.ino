/**
 * @file Weight.ino
 * @brief Example sketch that reads and reports MiP's payload weight sensor.
 *
 * @details
 * This sketch demonstrates how to query MiP's weight sensor and print
 * changes to mip.console. It repeatedly reads weight using weight.read() and
 * prints the value only when it changes to avoid spamming the serial output.
 * This is useful for monitoring payload changes on MiP's tray or detecting
 * when MiP is picked up or placed down.
 *
 * Demonstrated API:
 *   - mip.begin()
 *   - mip.weight.read()
 *
 * Usage notes:
 *   - Ensure MiP is powered and connected before running this sketch.
 *   - MiP must be standing upright, not propped on the kickstand.
 *   - Open mip.console to observe printed weight updates.
