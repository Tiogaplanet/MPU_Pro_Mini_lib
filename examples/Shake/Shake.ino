/**
 * @file Sleep.ino
 * @brief Demonstrates connecting, disconnecting, reconnecting, and sleeping
 * MiP.
 *
 * @details
 * This example shows how to manage a MiP connection from an MPU: D1 mini using
 * the MiP library. It demonstrates:
 *   - Establishing a UART connection with mip.begin()
 *   - Releasing the connection with mip.end()
 *   - Re-establishing the connection with mip.begin()
 *   - Putting MiP into a low-power sleep state with mip.sleep()
 *
 * The sketch prints status messages to mip.console so you can observe the chest
 * LED behavior and the connection lifecycle. Note that after calling
 * mip.sleep() MiP typically requires a power cycle before accepting new
 * connections.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - begin()
 *   - end()
 *   - sleep()

 * - On success, prints explanatory messages and demonstrates:
 *     1. Leaving the connection open for a short period (chest LED should be
 * green).
 *     2. Calling mip.end() to disconnect (chest LED should revert to blue).
 *     3. Reconnecting with mip.begin() to show chest LED returns to green.
 *     4. Calling mip.sleep() to put MiP into a low-power state (requires power
 * cycle to reconnect).
 *
 * The delays are included so the user can observe LED and connection state
