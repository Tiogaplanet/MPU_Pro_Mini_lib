/**
 * @file Shake.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating MiP shake detection.
 *
 * @details
 * This simple example initializes communication with a MiP and continuously
 * polls the device for shake events. When the MiP detects a shake, the sketch
 * prints a notification to Serial1. The sketch demonstrates basic use of the
 * MiP API for initialization and the shake-detection query:
 *   - begin()
 *   - shake.read()
 *
 * Typical usage:
 *   - Load this sketch onto the MPU: D1 mini connected to a MiP Power Up.
 *   - Open Serial1 to observe "Shake detected!" messages when the robot is shaken.
