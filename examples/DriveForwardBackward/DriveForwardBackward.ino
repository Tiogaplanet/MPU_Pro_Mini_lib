/**
 * @file DriveForwardBackward.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating MiP forward and backward drive commands.
 *
 * @details This sketch shows how to use the MiP library's driveForward() and
 * driveBackward() functions to move the robot a fixed speed for a specified
 * duration. The example drives forward for one second, waits, then drives
 * backward for one second. It prints status messages to mip.console to indicate
 * progress and completion.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - motion.driveForward()
 *   - motion.driveBackward()

 *  - Initializes communication with the MiP robot by calling mip.begin().
 *  - If the connection fails, prints an error to Serial and returns early.
 *  - If successful, prints a description of the demonstration and issues
 *    a forward drive command for 1000 ms, waits 2000 ms, then issues a
 *    backward drive command for 1000 ms and waits another 2000 ms.
 *
 * The function demonstrates non-blocking command usage where the MiP device
 * handles the timed motion while the sketch issues the commands.
