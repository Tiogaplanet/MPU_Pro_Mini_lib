/**
 * @file PlaySound.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating MiP's sound playback and sound lists.
 *
 * @details This sketch shows how to use the MiP library to play single sounds
 * and to build and play sound lists (sequences). It demonstrates playing a
 * single sound with sound.play(), creating a sound list with sound.beginList()
 * and sound.addEntryToList(), and playing the list with sound.playList(). The
 * example plays a single "drinking" sound, then constructs a two-entry sound
 * list (eating, then burping) with different volumes and repeats the list.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - mip.begin()
 *   - mip.sound.play()
 *   - mip.sound.beginList()
 *   - mip.sound.addEntryToList()
 *   - mip.sound.playList()
