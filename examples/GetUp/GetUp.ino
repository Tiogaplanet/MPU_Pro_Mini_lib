/**
 * @file GetUp.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating MiP's get-up behavior.
 *
 * @details This sketch shows how to use the MiP library to command MiP
 * to get up from resting on the kickstand and from face down on the tray.
 * As stated in WowWee's documentation, "MiP will attempt to get up from front
 * [or back] if angle is correct." Give MiP some room for this test because
 * MiP drives forward a bit after getting up from the kickstand.
 *
 * The sequence performed in setup() is:
 *   - Initialize communication with MiP.
 *   - Command MiP to get up from resting on the kickstand.
 *   - Command MiP to fall forward on the tray.
 *   - Attempt to get up again.
 *
 * The sketch prints status messages to mip.console so the user can observe the
 * sequence. The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - mip.begin()
 *   - mip.motion.fallForward()
 *   - mip.motion.getUp()
