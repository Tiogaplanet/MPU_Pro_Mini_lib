/**
 * @file RawSendReceive.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating MiP's raw send/receive operations.
 *
 * @details This sketch shows how to use the MiP library's serial.rawSend() and
 * serial.rawReceive() APIs to transmit and receive low-level MiP command
 * packets. The example sends a 4-byte command to set the chest LED to purple
 * and then requests MiP's firmware revision using a raw receive command. If a
 * valid firmware response is returned, the sketch prints a human-readable
 * software version string to mip.console.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - serial.rawSend()
 *   - serial.rawReceive()
