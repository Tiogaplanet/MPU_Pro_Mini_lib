/**
 * @file TurnLeftRight.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating turning MiP left and right.
 *
 * @details
 * This sketch connects to MiP and alternately commands turning 180 degrees left
 * and then 180 degrees right three times. It demonstrates how to use the MiP
 * motion APIs to perform rotational movements and how to sequence motions
 * using simple delays.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - mip.begin()
 *   - mip.motion.turnLeft()
 *   - mip.motion.turnRight()
 *
 * Usage notes:
 *   - Ensure MiP is powered and able to turn in the available space.
 *   - Adjust turn angles and speeds passed to turnLeft/turnRight to change
 *     behavior and responsiveness.

 * - If the connection fails, prints an error to Serial and returns early.
 * - On success, prints a short description and then performs three cycles of:
 *     1) motion.turnLeft(180, 12)
 *     2) delay(2000)
 *     3) motion.turnRight(180, 12)
 *     4) delay(2000)
 *
 * The second parameter to turnLeft/turnRight controls speed; adjust as needed.
