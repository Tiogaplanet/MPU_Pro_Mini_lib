/**
 * @file ZeroEEPROM.ino
 * @brief Example sketch that writes zeros to each byte of MiP's user EEPROM.
 *
 * @details
 * This sketch demonstrates how to iterate over MiP's user EEPROM address
 * range and write a zero value to each byte using the eeprom.write() API.
 * After writing each byte, the sketch reads it back with eeprom.read() and
 * prints the address and recovered value to mip.console for verification.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - mip.begin()
 *   - mip.eeprom.write()
 *   - mip.eeprom.read()
 *
 * Usage notes:
 *   - Running this sketch will overwrite MiP's user EEPROM contents with
 *     zeros. Use with caution if the EEPROM contains important data.
 *   - The sketch pauses one second between writes so the user can observe
 *     progress on mip.console.

 * - Iterates over MiP's user EEPROM address range from offset 0x00 up to
 *   (MiP_EEPROM::LAST_EEPROM_ADDRESS - MiP_EEPROM::BASE_EEPROM_ADDRESS)
 *   inclusive (offsets 0 to 15) and:
 *     1. Writes a zero to each EEPROM offset using eeprom.write(offset, 0x00).
 *     2. Waits one second to allow observation and avoid flooding UART.
 *     3. Reads the byte back with eeprom.read(offset) and prints the physical
 *        address and recovered value in hexadecimal to mip.console for
 * verification.
 *
 * Note:
 *   - This operation will irreversibly overwrite any existing user EEPROM
 *     data stored on MiP. Back up any important data before running.
