/**
 * @file DistanceDrive.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating MiP distance-based drive commands.
 *
 * @details This sketch shows how to use the MiP library to queue and execute
 * motion.distanceDrive() commands that move MiP forward/backward and rotate
 * specified degrees. The example queues a sequence of commands:
 *   - Drive forward 30 cm.
 *   - Turn 360 degrees left.
 *   - Turn 360 degrees right.
 *   - Drive backward 30 cm.
 *
 * Commands are queued with consecutive calls to distanceDrive() so MiP
 * executes them in order. Timing and queuing are handled by MiP's device
 * firmware; the sketch simply issues the commands during setup().
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - mip.begin()
 *   - mip.motion.distanceDrive()
