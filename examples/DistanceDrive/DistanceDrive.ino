/**
 * @file DistanceDrive.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating MiP distance-based drive commands.
 *
 * @details This sketch shows how to use the MiP library to queue and execute
 * motion.distanceDrive() commands that move the robot forward/backward and
 * rotate it by specified degrees. The example queues a sequence of commands:
 *   - Drive forward a short distance.
 *   - Turn 360 degrees left.
 *   - Turn 360 degrees right.
 *   - Drive backward a short distance.
 *
 * Commands are queued with consecutive calls to distanceDrive() so the robot
 * executes them in order. Timing and blocking are handled by the MiP device
 * firmware; the sketch simply issues the commands during setup().
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - motion.distanceDrive()

 *   2. Turn left 360 degrees in place.
 *   3. Turn right 360 degrees in place.
 *   4. Drive backward a short distance (30 units) without turning.
