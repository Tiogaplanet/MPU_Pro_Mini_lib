/**
 * @file ContinuousDrive.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating MiP's continuous drive control.
 *
 * @details This sketch shows how to use the MiP library's continuousDrive()
 * function to drive MiP with specified forward and backward speed and 
 * turning rate. The example drives forward with a right turn for
 * a fixed interval, then drives backward with a left turn for a fixed
 * interval, and then stops. Timing is implemented using millis() so the
 * loop remains non-blocking.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - motion.continuousDrive()
