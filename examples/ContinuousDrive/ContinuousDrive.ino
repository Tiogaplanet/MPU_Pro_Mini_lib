/**
 * @file ContinuousDrive.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating MiP continuous drive control.
 *
 * @details This sketch shows how to use the MiP library's continuousDrive()
 * function to drive MiP continuously with specified forward/backward speed
 * and turning rate. The example drives forward with a right turn for a fixed
 * interval, drives backward with a left turn for a fixed interval, and then
 * stops. Timing is implemented using millis() so the loop remains non-blocking.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - mip.begin()
 *   - mip.motion.continuousDrive()
 *   - mip.motion.stop()
