/**
 * @file ReadWriteEEPROM.ino
 * @brief Example sketch demonstrating reading and writing MiP user EEPROM.
 *
 * @details
 * This sketch demonstrates how to store and retrieve a single byte of user
 * data in the MiP's EEPROM using the eeprom.write() and eeprom.read() APIs.
 * It writes a test value (secretPassword) to an EEPROM offset, then reads it
 * back and prints the original, scrambled, and recovered values to Serial.
 *
 * The example shows how EEPROM data can be preserved across power cycles by
 * writing the value to the MiP device; to verify persistence, power-cycle the
 * MiP (or comment out the write call and reload the sketch) and observe the
 * recovered value.
 *
 * The example exercises these API calls:
 *   - eeprom.read()
 *   - eeprom.write()
